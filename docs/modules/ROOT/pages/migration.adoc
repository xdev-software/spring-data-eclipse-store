= Migration

Migrating from Spring Data JPA is very easy.
We implemented a https://github.com/xdev-software/spring-data-eclipse-store-migration[OpenRewrite recipe] for that.
It can be executed with a simple Maven command:

[source,title="Maven"]
----
mvn org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:run \
-Drewrite.recipeArtifactCoordinates=software.xdev:spring-data-eclipse-store-migration \
-Drewrite.activeRecipes=software.xdev.spring.data.eclipse.store.JpaMigration

== Data

To import data from different data sources like JPA, you can simply let the ``EclipseStoreDataImporterComponent`` get injected and then call ``importData()``.
This reads all instances of ``EntityManagerFactory``, creates EclipseStoreRepositories for it and then imports that data.
This can take quite some time if you have a lot of data.

[source,java,title="Maven"]
----
	@Autowired
	private EclipseStoreDataImporterComponent eclipseStoreDataImporter;

	void importDataFromJpaToEclipseStore()
	{
		final List<SimpleEclipseStoreRepository<?, ?>> repositories = this.eclipseStoreDataImporter.importData();
	}
----

After that you can change your JpaRepositories to EclipseStoreRepositories and you're done.
