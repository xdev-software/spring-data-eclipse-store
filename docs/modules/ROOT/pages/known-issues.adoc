== Query annotations

In Spring-Data-JPA you can write a Query over methods of repositories like this:

[source,java,title="From https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/blob/main/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerRepository.java[spring-petclinic]"]
----
@Query("SELECT ptype FROM PetType ptype ORDER BY ptype.name")
List<PetType> findPetTypes();
----

We created https://github.com/xdev-software/spring-data-eclipse-store/issues/32[an issue] for that but right now we *do not support Query annotations*.

== Data changes

There are two basic ways to keep your data up to date.

=== Structural

As with most projects, data that needs persisting changes over time.
In EclipseStore that's handled through https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/legacy-type-mapping/index.html[Legacy Type Mapping].

That consists of https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/legacy-type-mapping/index.html#_automatic_mapping[Automatic Mapping] through EclipseStores internal heuristic and https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/legacy-type-mapping/index.html#explicit-mapping[Explicit Mapping] by the user.

=== Values

There is a library to version your data in the store called https://github.com/xdev-software/micro-migration[XDEV MicroMigration].
This helps you keep your data up to date regardless of the current version.

We created https://github.com/xdev-software/spring-data-eclipse-store/issues/33[an issue] for that but right now we *do not support XDEVs MicroMigration*.

== Spring Developer Tools

Using https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/devtools.html[Spring Developer Tools] (`spring-boot-devtools`) can lead to serious issues in your project.
That is manly due to the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/devtools.html#using.devtools.livereload[LiveReload feature] and the usage of a "Restart Classloader".

This leads to problems within EclipseStore and can cause issues with discovering beans (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/41011[Example Issue]).

If you must use the Spring Developer Tools, make sure to https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/devtools.html#using.devtools.restart.disable[disable restart].

[source,java,title="Example how to disable restart"]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.setProperty("spring.devtools.restart.enabled", "false");
		SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
	}
}
