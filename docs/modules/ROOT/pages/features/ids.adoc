= IDs

{product-name} supports the following types with auto generating (``GenerationType.AUTO``) values:

* ``int`` / ``Integer``
* ``long`` / ``Long``
* ``String``
* ``UUID``

Other generation types are currently not supported.

== Composite keys

It is possible to use **any class as https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.2/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/id[``@Id``]** but without any auto generation.
Most importantly the used class **must have a valid ``hashCode``** since a ``HashMap`` is used to store and manage entities.

{product-name} can also handle https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.2/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/embeddedid[``@EmbeddedId``] which results in the same behavior as ``@Id`` but the id-class must then implement ``Serializable``.

Multiple Ids for a single entity and https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.2/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/idclass[``@IdClass``] are **not** supported.
