/**
 * Currently only exists to write a warning at runtime.
 * <p>
 * The library should be as compatible as possible with Spring JPA.
 * A <code>@Query</code>-Annotation is often used in these projects.
 * Keeping these annotations existing in code would cause an error. With this class the user can use the
 * annotation as before except with a different import. While running the application a warning is shown to
 * indicate that this is something to look after. It doesn't cause any problems, but it also doesn't do what
 * the user is used to in Spring JPA. This annotation does effectively nothing except write the warning message.
